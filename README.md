## Project Overview

In this project, the data of 1000 customers' spends and ages are provided. The purpose of this project is to figure out how spending habit changes with time as well as how well different models can capture the relationship between spending and age.

This project is mainly divided into five steps:

1. `Splitting Dataset into Training Set and Test Test`

2. `Applying Decision Tree Model`

3. `Applying Linear Regression Model` in this part, the tree depth of both 2 and 5 were applied.

4. `Applying Random Forest Regression Model` in this part, the tree depth of both 2 and 5 were applied. 

5. `Evaluating Three Models by RMSE and Visualization`
